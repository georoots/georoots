## GeoRoots: Open Source Toolkit for EUDR Compliance and geo traceability

GeoRoots is a collection of minimalistic, open-source tools designed specifically to meet EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) requirements and enhance geo traceability.

The core idea of these tools is to simplify working with GeoJSON format as required by EU DDS.

Our philosophy is simple: provide useful tools that respect your privacy, work offline (where possible), and require no complex setup or subscription fees. Every tool runs entirely in your browser and can be downloaded for offline use.
